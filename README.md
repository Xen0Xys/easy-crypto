# Easy Crypto

Easy Crypto is a TypeScript cryptography library designed to prevent misuse while providing a simple and secure interface for WebCrypto, hashing functions, and JWT usage.

## Features

- **Simple API:** Offers a straightforward interface to handle cryptographic operations.
- **AES-GCM Support:** Provides implementations for AES-GCM for secure symmetric encryption.
- **Hashing Functions:** Includes implementations for robust hash functions such as SHA-256 and Argon2.
- **JWT Integration:** Facilitates the generation and verification of JSON Web Tokens.
- **Type Safety:** Built entirely in TypeScript to ensure a robust developer experience and reduce runtime errors.

## Installation

To use Easy Crypto in your project, ensure you have Node.js installed. You can then install the library via your package manager if itâ€™s published, or build it from source.

Clone this repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Install the dependencies:

npm install

## Usage

After installation or building the project, you can import and use the various modules in your TypeScript code. For instance:

```typescript
// Importing the AES-GCM cipher implementation
import { encrypt, decrypt } from './src/ciphers/aes-gcm';

// Encrypting data
const cipherText = encrypt(plainText, key);

// Decrypting data
const plainText = decrypt(cipherText, key);
```

Similarly, you can use the hashing functions:

```typescript
// Import a hash function
import { sha256 } from './src/hashes/hashes';

const digest = sha256(data);
```

Adapt the examples as needed to fit your application's requirements.

## Build & Test

Easy Crypto uses modern JavaScript tooling. Key scripts defined in the project include:

- **Build:**  
  Build and bundle the project for browser environment:

      bun build --minify --target=browser ./src/index.ts --outfile=dist/index.js
      bun run build:declaration

- **Lint:**  
  Automatically fix lint issues:

      eslint --fix .

- **Test:**  
  Run the test suite with Bun:

      bun test

These scripts ensure that the library is production-ready and free from common issues.
